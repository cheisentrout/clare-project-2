## User Stories and Wireframes

### Day 1

- wrote MVC file structure
- set up create, read, update and delete routes for my students collection

### Day 2

- The biggest issue I'm running into today is how to redirect to a page from my /class router after I've created a portfolio in the portfolio router.
  - I ended up needing to delete the first parameter ('/portfolio') from my app.use method! I was able to redirect much easily from the project's home directory once that was removed.
- Some other challenges have been: how to tell the server to ignore parts of my ejs file if the data doesn't exist...
